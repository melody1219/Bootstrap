          <h3>Speed-card game</h3>
          <p>Sort out the cards by putting black cards into one pile, and red in another.  Each person takes a deck of cards and shuffled them.  When you are done, exchange piles with your partner.  Put the deck slightly to the left, and place four cards next to it, neatly spread out.  Count to three, and each person draws a card from their pile, starting two piles in the middle.  Then, you need to speed up.  For example, the cards in the middle are 1 and 5.  You can quickly take 2 or king and slam it on top of the 1, or put 6 or 4 on top of the 5.  You can only use the four cards beside your main deck.  If you draw the same number, simply place it on top of the same number.  If both people don't have cards that can go on top of the pile, you do the same thing you did in the beggining, and start on the old piles.  If you get a joker card, you can place any number on top of it.  The first person to run out of cards wins.</p>

          <h3>Poem: Sea Breeze</h3>
          <p>
            Ocean sea,</p>
            <p>Inside of me,</p>
            <p>Seems so deep,</p>
            <p>In a sleep.</p>
            <p>             </p>
            <p>Ocean breeze,</p>
            <p>Never leaves,</p>
            <p>Always right,</p>
            <p>Next to me.
